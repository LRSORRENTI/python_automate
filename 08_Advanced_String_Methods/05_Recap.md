# Recap

- Strings can begin and end with single, double, and even triple qoutes '', "", """

- Escape characters allow you to put quotes within qoutes, and other characters that need to be added inside of a string

- Raw strings will print any backslashes in the string and ignore escape characters

- Multi-line strings begin and end with triple qoutes, and can span multiple lines

- Many list methods like splice, indexing, and the in / not in operators work with strings because strings are 'list-like'
