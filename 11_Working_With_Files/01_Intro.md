# Working with files in python

When working with any kind of file, it will need to be named, and saved somewhere

What are files?

Each file has two things:

1. A file name: myFile.txt

2. A specific and unique file path pointing to that file: C:\Users\user1\Desktop\CURRENT-PROJECTS\automate_python\11_Working_With_Files\myFile.txt

Files also will usually have a file extension, like .py, .txt, .png, .md etc...

### Note: On windows, you need to use the escape character to include the \, or alternatively in python you can also use raw strings to omit this double backslash syntax:

r'c:\spam\eggs.png'

without raw string

'c:\\spam\\eggs.png'
