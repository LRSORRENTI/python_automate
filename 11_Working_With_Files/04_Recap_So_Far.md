# Recap

- All files have a name and a path

- The root folder is the lowest folder, it's C:\ on windows and / on Linux & Mac

- Ina file path, the folders and filename are separated by backslashes on windows, and forward slashes on Linux and Mac

- Use the os.path.join() function to combine folders with the correct slash

- The current working directory is the folder that any relative paths are relative to

- os.getcwd() returns the current working directory

- os.chdir() changes the current working directory

- Absolute paths begin with the root folder, relative paths do not

- The . folder represents 'the folder', while .. folder represents the parent folder
