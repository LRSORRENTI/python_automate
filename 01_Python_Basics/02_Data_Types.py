# Data Types: 

# All values in python belong to a specific data 
# type: 

# INTEGERS(Ints): Whole numbers like -2 and 40

# FLOATING POINT(Floats): Decimal point numbers like:
# 3.14 or 2.1
# Note: 42 is an int, but 42.0 is a float 

# STRINGS: Text values wrapped between single quotation
# marks are string values like 'Hello World', strings 
# are also able to be concatenated using the '+' 
# operator: 

print('Hello' + ' ' + 'World' + '!') # Hello World!

# String replication can be implemented using the 
# '*' multiplication operand

print('hello' * 3) # hellohellohello

print('Hello' + '!' * 5) # Hello!!!!!

# VARIABLES: Variables are used to assign values: 

name = 'Luke';

print(name) # Luke
print('Hello' + ' ' + name) # Hello Luke

# Variables can be reassigned: 

name = 'Peter'
print(name) # Peter

# You can also chain together expressions and operands:

opera = 'Good'
print(opera) # Good

opera = opera + ' ' + 'day for an opera' 
print(opera) # Good day for an opera
