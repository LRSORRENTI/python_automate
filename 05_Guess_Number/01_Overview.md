# Guess The Number Game

This is a nice program to build in order to test everything we've learned so far

It first generates a random number between 1 - 20 and saves it to a variable

It then asks the user to guess a number that's in range of 1 - 20

If the user's guess is too high or too low it prints the corresponding user feedback string

If the user guesses correctly it prints a congratulatory message including a move tracker to display how many guesses it takes for them to correctly identify the secret number

If it takes the user more than 6 guesses, they lose the game and need to try again
