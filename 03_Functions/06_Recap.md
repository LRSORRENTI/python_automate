# Recap

- Functions are like mini-programs inside a program

- The main point of functions is to get rid of duplicated code blocks

- The 'def' keyword is used to prefix and define function names before execution

- The inputs to functions are arguments, the output
  is known as the return value

- The return value must always be prefixed with the 'return' keyword

- Every function has a return value, even if it doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns the None data type

- The parameters are the variables that are used in the definition of the function between parentheses, when calling the function these parameters are known as arguments passed in

- Keyword arguments to functions are usually for optional arguments, the print() function for example has keyword arguments 'end' and 'sep'
