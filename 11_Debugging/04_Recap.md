# Recap

- You can raise your own exceptions:

```
raise Exception('This is a custom exception error')
```

- You also can use assertions:

```
assert condition: 'Error message'
```

- Assertions are for detecting programmmer errors and are not meant to be recovered from, user errors should raise exceptions
