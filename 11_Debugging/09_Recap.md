# Recap

- The debugger is a tool to execute Python code line by line and show what the state of each variable is at that specific time

- Step over will step over the specified line of code and pause on the next line

- The step button will step into a function call

- The Out button will step out of the current function you're inside of

- The Go button will continue the program until the next breakpoint or end of the program

- The Quit button will immediately terminate the program

- Breakpoints can be set on any line you wish
