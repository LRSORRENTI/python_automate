# Intro to Dictionaries in Python

Dictionaries are similar to object types in other languages, they use key value pairs to structure data, and use brackets to access values with keys

```
myDogs = {
    'rey': 'German Shepherd',
    'maggie': 'Cava-Corgi'
}

myDogs['rey'] # 'German Shepher'



```
