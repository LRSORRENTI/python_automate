# Line Continuation 

# In python as you've noticed, uses indentation to 
# structure and define code blocks, but you can 
# use line Continuation if needed: 

myTODOList = ['Walk dogs','Cook food',
              'Exercise','Study']

# You can even do this whenever needed using the '\'
# backslash line Continuation character 
def printName(name):
    print(\
        name)

print('Luke')
