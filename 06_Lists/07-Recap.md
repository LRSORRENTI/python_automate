# Lists Recap:

- Methods are functions available on certain data types

- The index() method will return the exact index of a value in a list

- The append() method will add a value to the last index or end of a list

- The insert() method will insert a value at the specified index of a list

- The remove() method will remove any item that matches the passed in value from the list

- The sort() method sorts the list items

- The .sort(reverse=True) will sort the list in reverse

- the sort() method sorts ASCII-Betically, not alphabetically by default, to sort by true alphabetical order pass in .sort(key=str.lower)

- These list methods operate on the list "in place", always make a copy of a list if you know it shouldn't be directly mutated
