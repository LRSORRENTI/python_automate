# Recap from Intro.py

- A list is a value that contains multiple values of the same or different data types

- The values are also called list items

- You can access specific items in a list using the item index

- The first item in a list starts at index 0, not index 1

- You can used negative indexes to quickly find the final item in a list

- You can return multiple values from a list using slice

- Slice has two values passed in, if you omit the first value :2 it will start at index 0 and grab the two indexed following 0, :2 is effectively the same as 0:2

- If you omit the second value of slice it will grab all list items following the specified index 1:

- The len function, + concatention, and \* replication can be used on lists to get the length, join, and replicate

- You can convert any value into a list using the built in list() function
