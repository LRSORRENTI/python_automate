# Recap

- A divide by zero error occurs when Python tries to divide any number by zero

- Errors that cause the program to crash, i.e. invalid input types

- An error that happens inside the try block will cause code in the except block to execute, that code can handle the error or display a message to the user so that the program can keep going
